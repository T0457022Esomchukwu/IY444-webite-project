The Dish pages, such as Nigerian Fried Rice, Chicken Shawarma, Pancake & Corned beef sauce and Nigerian Egg sauce all lead to the Google Forms website to display the user’s score after the completion of a quiz.









Design Philosophy
Colours
This website implements the mixture of different shades of green and white. These colours were chosen because of the impactful meanings behind them. Different shades of green were applied in this website, as green is a reassuring colour, it is frequently linked with nature, and it represents growth, hope and cleanliness, as stated by Beaird and George (2014). As for white, Beaird and George (2014) state that in Western cultures, the colour white is always associated with properties such as perfection, purity and light. Although white and green were used for these reasons, they were also used as they are the colours that represent the Nigerian flag, as the content of this site is based on Nigerian dishes. According to Ibanga (2013), the Nigerian flag is equally divided into three parts with white at the centre and green at both ends. The colour green represents agriculture, while the white represents peace and prosperity. From the dual meanings gotten from these colours, it is perfect for a foundation for a website to reflect their interpretations. The background of this website includes a linear gradient transitioning from white (#FFFFFF) to light greyish green (#D7E8D1), greyish lime green (#A3C89B) and mostly desaturated dark lime green (#65A665). All multimedia elements in this site are displayed in a background of dark moderate lime green (#4CAF50) with a font colour of white (#FFFFFF).

Layout
This website uses a fluid layout in which it is divided into four sections. These sections are the Navigation, Header, Main and Footers. This website utilises a fluid layout because of its ability to change its size. According to Beaird and George (2014), the page wrapper stretches when the browser window is adjusted due to the widths of the site being based on percentages. This allows for content in the browser window to adjust in size based on the size of the viewport, making it usable across all devices.  On all pages in this site, the navigation menu is located at the uppermost and lowermost sections which allows for access to main areas of the website, according to Lynch et al (2016). Following that is the header, which gives the user information about the contents of a page, as highlighted by Krug (2013). Subsequently, the main, which consists of essential content elements, which helps people using screen readers directly go to the main content of the page, as described by Lynch et al (2016).On the homepage, the main, comprising of a grid system, allows for the accommodation of a variety of materials for communication and the organisation of space, as stated by Tondreau (2019).This grid system allows for easy scanning, making it simple for users to understand the content and find what they need. As described by Lynch et al. (2016), the footer indicates the conclusion of a page. It includes navigation links which allow users to move around the website and the website’s copyright information.

Font
This website uses a typography approach, employing specific font styles, spacing and font size for accessibility reasons. For dyslexic Users, the Calibri font style is adopted on this site, as British Dyslexia Associations (n.d) describes that letters in the sans serif fonts seem less congested. British Dyslexia Associations (n.d) recommends a font size of 16-19px, in which a font size of 19 px was employed for dyslexic users. As for the spacing of the text in this website, W3C (2024) suggests that in regard to accessibility the letter and word spacing should be at least 0.12 and 0.16 times the font size, respectively. These styling features ensure that the text content is properly spaced, allowing for different types of users to consume the content.

Media
This website uses various forms of multimedia for learning purposes. According to Mayer (2008), the purpose of using audiovisual media on this webpage is that users retain information better with illustrations alongside audio rather than just written text. The multimedia in this website includes text, images, audio and video. To improve user clarity, this website utilizes a segmented structure whereby the user can move at their own pace as described by Mayer (2008). In which the audio and video content can be manipulated at the user’s volition. Most images on this site were placed alongside text in the instruction section. To prioritise accessibility, all images on this website utilises an ALT attribute. This allows for visually impaired users to have an alternative text description of images, as highlighted byW3C(2024). The audio on this website contains the text content displayed in the ingredients and instructions sections with some additional details in an audio format. Whereby the ingredients and instructions sections act as a transcript for the audio section. Videos on this website contain visual representations of the instructions section along with a narrative audio and captions. These various multimedia elements were utilised as they guide users through each step enhancing the learning experience of the user.
Navigation UI
The website’s navigation includes navigation tabs, a search bar and scroll-to-top buttons. The navigation tabs positioned at the top and bottom of each page, provides access to major areas of this website, as highlighted by Lynch et al (2016). These pages on the website include the Home, About, Contact Us and dish pages. Additionally, a search bar was implemented as it assists users through their entire search journey, from the structure of their information request to understanding their result, as described by Hearst (2009). The search bar is located on the homepage, in which its purpose is to display dishes from queries gotten from users. Finally, the scroll-to-top button, when clicked, returns the user to the top of the page.
Technology
This website was built with the use of various types of programming languages. These languages include Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript. According to Hutchinson (2013), the framework of this website was defined by HTML, using various attributes and tags.HTML5 was the version of HTML that was implemented in this website due to its various advantages. According to Rajesh and Srikanth (2015), HTML5 supports various multimedia such as audio, video and animations without relying on proprietary technologies. Additionally, it is compatible across all platforms as it displays websites on devices such as smart TVs, phones, tablets or personal computers.CSS was used in this webpage to define the visual representation of the HTML as described by Pouncey and York (2011). By implementing CSS elements such as colour, animations and font styling, this webpage became more visually appealing. This website also utilises JavaScript, offering progressive visual effects, animation and interactive features as described by McFarland and Sawyer (2014). These features will be discussed in the Scripting section below.

Scripting
To add functionality to this website pure JavaScript without relying on external libraries or frameworks. These features include:
1.Active navigation tab
2.Email validation
3.Live clock
4.Search bar
5.Back to the top button

Active navigation tab

 
Figure 33:Screenshot of this website’s Active navigation tab

JavaScript:
//(Shields,2011)
var url = window.location.pathname.split("/"); 
var navLinks = document.getElementsByTagName("nav")[0].getElementsByTagName("a");
var i=0;
var currentPage = url[url.length - 1];
for(i;i<navLinks.length;i++){
    var lb = navLinks[i].href.split("/");
    if(lb[lb.length-1] == currentPage) {
    navLinks[i].className = "current";
    }
    }
CSS:
/*(Shields,2011)*/
nav a.current {    
    
    background-color: #006400;
    border-radius:10px ;
}
This feature was implemented to show users the page they are currently on as shown in Figure 33. The code snippets above were obtained from Shields’ (2011) comment on Stack Overflow and they will be explained below:
var url = window.location.pathname.split("/"); 
var navLinks = document.getElementsByTagName("nav")[0].getElementsByTagName("a");
In this code snippet, a variable, url, is created to collect the current URL path and it splits it into an array. navLinks variable is created to get all elements with a<nav> tag and then get all elements with an <a> tag and then store it. 

var i=0;
var currentPage = url[url.length - 1];
for(i;i<navLinks.length;i++){
    var lb = navLinks[i].href.split("/");
    if(lb[lb.length-1] == currentPage) {
    navLinks[i].className = "current";
    }
    }
/*(Shields,2011)*/
nav a.current {    
    
    background-color: #006400;
    border-radius:10px ;
}

Variable i is created and set to zero to act as a counter in the for loop. currentPage variable gets the last part of the current page’s URL and stores it. The for loop is used to go through the each element with an <a> tag and compares its URL to the current page’s URL to it and if it matches the element with an <a> tag gets a class called current. In which the <a> elements of the current class gets highlighted with dark green (#006400).

Email validation
 
Figure 34: Screenshot of this website’s Email validation

JavaScript:    
//(GreatStack,2022)
var emailField=document.getElementById("email-field");
var emailError=document.getElementById("email-error"); 
function validateEmail(){

    if (!emailField.value.match(/^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$/)){
        emailError.innerHTML="Please enter a valid email";
        return false;

    }
    emailError.innerHTML="";    
    return true;          
    
}
CSS:
/*(GreatStack,2022)*/
#email-error{
    color:red;
    margin-left:10px;
} 

HTML:
 <!--(GreatStack,2022)-->
        <input type="email" name ="email address" placeholder="Your Email address..." class="contact_inputs" spellcheck="false" id="email-field" required onkeyup="validateEmail()" >
        <span id="email-error"></span>

This website employs an email validation system as shown in Figure34.This feature was implemented to prevent user errors when submitting the form in the Contact Us page. It filters out the email address inputs that include symbols, missing domain name and missing @ symbol. The code snippets shown above were gotten from GreatStack’s (2022)YouTube tutorials.
 <!--(GreatStack,2022)-->
        <input type="email" name ="email address" placeholder="Your Email address..." class="contact_inputs" spellcheck="false" id="email-field" required onkeyup="validateEmail()" >
        <span id="email-error"></span>
The input field of type email was given the id of email-field to use later in JavaScript code and spellcheck is set to false to disable the spell checking by the browser. This input field has an event handler called onkeyup which is used to call the validateEmail() function every time a user releases a key. The span input field has an id of email-error to be used later in JavasScript
.
var emailField=document.getElementById("email-field");
var emailError=document.getElementById("email-error"); 
Variable emailField and emailError were created to get an element with an Id of email-field and email-error respectively

function validateEmail(){

    if (!emailField.value.match(/^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$/)){
        emailError.innerHTML="Please enter a valid email";
        return false;
    }
    emailError.innerHTML="";    
    return true;          
  }

/*(GreatStack,2022)*/
#email-error{
    color:red;
    margin-left:10px;
} 
The validateEmail() function is called every time a user releases a key in the input field of an Id of emailField. This function is used to validate the inputs gotten from the user. The condition in this function checks if the user input has an invalid email format, such as  invalid symbols, missing @ symbol and  a missing domain name. If that is true, the “Please enter a valid email” gets passed into the <span> element of an Id of emailError in which is associated CSS highlights it red. If the condition is false, then the function clears the <span> element’s content, removing any previous error message.

Live Clock
 
Figure 35: Screenshot of this website’s Live Clock

JavaScript:
function runTime(){
    var getDate = new Date();//This is to get the date
    var Change = getDate.toLocaleTimeString();//This is to change the date into a string
    var post = document.querySelector('.time').innerHTML=Change;//Displays Change variable into time div
    
}
setInterval(runTime,0);
CSS:
/*THis is for the Live clock*/
.time{
    background-color:#4caf50;
    font-size: 25px;
    width:190px;
    height: 45px;
    padding:6px;
    text-align: center;
    border-radius: 15px;
    margin:30px 0px 0px;
}


HTML
<!--(The Wheelchair Guy,2021)-->
    <div class ="time">
    </div>

As shown in Figure 35, this site implements a live clock which tells the current time of the day. These HTML and JavaScript code blocks were acquired from The Wheelchair Guy’s (2011) YouTube tutorial.


<!--(The Wheelchair Guy,2021)-->
    <div class ="time">
    </div>
This HTML code shown above creates a <div> element  with a class of time, where the current time will be displayed.

function runTime(){
    var getDate = new Date();//This is to get the date
    var Change = getDate.toLocaleTimeString();//This is to change the date into a string
    var post = document.querySelector('.time').innerHTML=Change;//Displays Change variable into time div
}
setInterval(runTime,0);

The runTime function is used to display the current time in the <div> element with a class of time. The getDate variable gets the current date object and stores. The Change variable contains the converted Date object in a string format. The post variable displays the Change variable into the <div> element with a class of time. The function is called repeatedly by the browser because setInterval(runTime,0);.
Search Bar

JavaScript:
    //(ChatGpt,2025)
function search() {
    let filter = document.querySelector('.search-input').value.toUpperCase(); // This is to get input values
    let items = document.querySelectorAll('.dish'); // This is to get all dishes
    
    items.forEach(item => {
        let nameElement = item.querySelector('.name'); // This is to get the dish name
        if (nameElement) {
            let value = nameElement.textContent.toUpperCase();
            if (value.indexOf(filter) > -1) {
                item.style.display = ""; // This is to show matching items
            } else {
                item.style.display = "none"; // This is to hid non matching items
            }
        }
    });
}

document.querySelector('.search-input').addEventListener('input', search);

    </form>


As shown in Figure 36, is the search tab. This tab was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This feature is used to display dishes based on the input from the user. The Javascript code snippet was obtained from ChatGPT (2025) while the HTML and CSS was acquired from decode’s (2023) YouTube tutorial.

let filter = document.querySelector('.search-input').value.toUpperCase(); // This is to get input values
    let items = document.querySelectorAll('.dish'); // This is to get all dishes

The filter and item variables are used to get and store the user input and the elements in the dish class respectively.

items.forEach(item => {
        let nameElement = item.querySelector('.name'); // This is to get the dish name
        if (nameElement) {
            let value = nameElement.textContent.toUpperCase();
            if (value.indexOf(filter) > -1) {
                item.style.display = ""; // This is to show matching items
            } else {
                item.style.display = "none"; // This is to hid non matching items

        }
    });
From  the code snippet above, the code loops through each dish stored in the items variable and gets the name of a dish. The condition in this code checks if the name of the dish contains the user’s query. If that condition is true, the dish will be displayed otherwise the dishes will be hidden.

JavaScript
//(LearnDesign,2021)
function scrollToTop(){
    window.scrollTo(0,0);
}


CSS
/*(LearnDesign,2021)*/
  scroll-behavior: smooth;

/*(LearnDesign,2021)*/
.scrollTop{
    position:fixed;
    bottom:20px;
    right: 10px;
    text-align: center;
    padding:8px;
    max-width:44px;
    height:40px;
    background-color:#4caf50;
    border-radius : 5px;
    cursor:pointer;
    transition:all 0.5s ease 0s;
    transition: transform 0.1s ease-in-out;
}
.scrollTop:hover{
    background-color:#006400;
    transform: scale(1.05);
}

HTML:
 <!--(LearnDesign,2021)-->
    <div onclick ="scrollToTop()" class="scrollTop">
        <!-- (Google,n.d)-->
        <span class="material-symbols-outlined">
        arrow_upward
        </span></div>


Figure 37, illustrates the scroll-to-top button, which takes a user scroll-to-top of the page from wherever they are. To implement this feature, the code snippets shown above were derived from LearnDesign’s (2021) YouTube tutorial.


 <!--(LearnDesign,2021)-->
    <div onclick ="scrollToTop()" class="scrollTop">
        <!-- (Google,n.d)-->
        <span class="material-symbols-outlined">
        arrow_upward
        </span></div> 

The <div> element with the scrollTop class acts as the scroll to the top button. When it is clicked the scrollToTop() function is called.

//(LearnDesign,2021)
function scrollToTop(){
    window.scrollTo(0,0);
}
When the scrollToTop ()function is called, it uses window.scrollTo(0,0) to take the user back  to the top of the page.

Testing

Reflection	
All the functional requirements that were given have been completed by this website. This website successfully communicates its topic, which is Nigerian recipes. All multimedia on this site were created by the creator of the website, as no external or copyright media were used. As the multimedia elements include text, images, audio and video. The whole website contains 7 pages in total, which include the Home, About, Contact Us and the 4 dish pages. To create this website, various technologies were used, such as Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript.HTML was used for the structure of the content on this website, CSS was utilised for the design elements, and the functionality of the website was created by JavaScript. In creating this site, no in-line CSS styling was used, as all the CSS code is in an external stylesheet file. This site works on all internet browsers and across all devices, which makes it transportable.
Strengths
Functionality: This website provides various features that make it fairly functional. Those features include an active navigation tab, a live clock, a search bar, a scroll-to-top button, quizzes and a contact page. The active navigation feature highlights the current navigation tab, which indicates which page the user is on. The live clock displays the current time of the day even down to the second. When the user is at the bottom of the page, the scroll-to-top button located at the bottom right corner of the page takes the user to the top, which improves user experience as it reduces time wasting and user effort. The search bar located on the homepage allows users to find specific dishes based on their queries. Quizzes were implemented on all food pages to test the user on the knowledge they had gained from each recipe. This website has a contact page in which a user can type in their name, email and a message. This feature was primarily implemented for user feedback and suggestions so that the website can be regularly updated based on that. 
Multimedia: This webpage employs different forms of multimedia, which include text, images, audio and video. These multimedia elements were utilised, as they offer various ways for different users to learn, such as using visual representations, listening to audio and just reading plain text.
Personalisation: The about page in this website contains a picture as well as a description of the owner/creator of the website. This is to foster a personal connection with the user, making the website more engaging.
Navigation: This website uses simple navigation for the user to move around the site. This simple navigation includes the search bar and the navigation bar. The search bar is located on the homepage, as it allows users to find specific content.  The navigation bar located at the top of every page on the website allows the user easily to move through all pages of the website without difficulty.
Accessibility: This website accounts for people with dyslexia and screen readers. The typographic features were chosen out of regards to dyslexic users to make it easier for them to read text from the website. Additionally, the layout uses main tags, as this allows screen readers to jump right into the main content of a page.

Weaknesses
Creativity: This website would have greatly benefitted a lot from more creativity, as the website feels simplistic. More design elements should have been implemented to make the website more attractive, which would improve user experience.
 
Figure 38:Screenshot of colour contrast between white and #4CAF50 calculated by WebAIM (n.d).
Accessibility: The colour scheme of this website, which consists of white and green. The text content of this consists of a white font colour in a background colour of #4CAF50.The colour contrast ratio between these two colours fails to meet WCAG Level AA and Level AAA requirements. As W3C (2024) states, to meet Level AA and Level AAA standards, the contrast ratio of text needs to be at least 4.5:1 or 7:1, respectively. In which the contrast ratio of 2.77:1 between white and #4CAF50, determined by WebAIM (n.d), shown in Figure 38, fails to meet WCAG Level AA and Level AAA requirements.
Navigation: Although the navigation of this site is simple, there should have been more navigation options for the user to navigate through the website, such as breadcrumbs and previous and next navigation links.

Areas of Improvement
This website could improve by implementing more design elements to make the website more attractive, as it would improve user experience. Using a more accessible colour combination to accommodate for colour blind users or creating a colour selector to keep the original green and white theme to allow users to switch to a more colour blind friendly colour. Addition of more navigation elements, such as breadcrumbs, to show the user the steps they have taken to reach their current page, and previous and next navigation links to allow users to move from one dish to another.

Issues Identified
There were some issues that were encountered during the creation and testing of this website, which will be explained below. Firstly, in the creation of this website, responsiveness was not taken into account, so when the window size changes, the content retains the original window size because of the use of fixed widths and CSS Grid. This issue was resolved by using relative widths and percentages and flexbox, as flex items resize to fit inside their container. Secondly, creating the content was strenuous since the creation of each dish had to be documented. Thirdly, in the creation of this site, the implementation of JavaScript was difficult as the programming language is intellectually challenging. Fortunately, YouTube tutorials and educational websites were utilised to learn and understand JavaScript. Fourthly, issues were encountered during the styling of the scroll-to-top button. All pages on this website use a Google arrow icon to represent the button. However, the arrow icon could not be displayed on the homepage due to the use of the search icon for the search bar, in which the word ‘Top’ was used as a replacement. Additionally, while the website is responsive, when the browser window is adjusted, the scroll-to-top button overlaps with the contents in each webpage. After numerous efforts, these issues could not be fixed. Finally, the email validation uses JavaScript to allow alphanumeric characters, the @ symbol and domain names. This validation system also filters out emails with symbols, missing @ symbols and missing domain name. However, this validation system fails to account for the amount of numbers in an email address. Unfortunately, no solution was found to curb that issue.

Lessons Learnt

If there were a fresh start
Responsiveness should have been considered earlier in the creation of this website, as it was a fixed width website when it was first created. A more accessible colour combination would have been chosen in respect to accessibility, as the contrast ratio of the colours in this site falls below the WCAG standards. The layout would have been changed to include sidebars for more engaging content. A recipe page should have been created to store the dish’s recipes, while the homepage would have had its own content. The content of this website would have been based on a different topic, as the creation of content for Nigerian dishes was strenuous.

If more time were given
More dynamic and interactive features using JavaScript would have been added. Features such as a progress bar to show the user how much of the page has been read, autocomplete for the search bar on the homepage to allow users to find what they are looking for quickly, and a colour picker to choose more accessible colours for colour blind users. Additionally, more content would have been added to make the website look more complete.

If unlimited resources were given
This website will be community driven and hosted on the cloud. It would have been designed to handle large amounts of users while maintaining exceptional speed and strong security. Users would be able to join the community by logging in or registering. There will be engaging features such as a comment section and a rating system. To create the content of this website, a studio would have been utilised along with professional content creation equipment such as the Sony ZV-1 II digital camera for high quality videos and the COLBOR PL8R for optimal lighting.
